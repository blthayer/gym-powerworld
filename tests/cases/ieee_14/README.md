# ieee_14
IEEE 14-bus test case downloaded from [here](https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/ieee-14-bus-system/)
on 2019-10-15.

## contour.axd
PowerWorld .axd file generated through the "Contour" menu. Used for 
rendering.

## IEEE 14 bus.axd
PowerWorld .axd file that represents the entire oneline, including the
contouring created for `contour.axd`.

## IEEE 14 bus.epc
Shipped with original case.

## IEEE 14 bus.pwb
PowerWorld binary that came with the original case.

## IEEE 14 bus.pwd
PowerWorld display file that came with the original case.

## IEEE 14 bus.raw
Shipped with original case.

## IEEE 14 bus.condensers.PWB
The MW limits (low and high) have been set to 0 for the generators at
buses 3, 6, and 8. This represents how the original case was intended to
be, and also matches what the GridMind folks did in their work (they
didn't dispatch real power from those generators in their scenarios).
