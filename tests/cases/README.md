## ieee_14
IEEE 14-bus test case downloaded from [here](https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/ieee-14-bus-system/)
on 2019-10-15. There are now some additional files that did not come
with the original case, as described in the README found in that 
directory.

## tx_2000
Synthetic 2000 bus case representing Texas (but ficitional!). The 
version here has been modified for voltage control by Diana Wallison
from the original case which can be found [here](https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/activsg2000/).
